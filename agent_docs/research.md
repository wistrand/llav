# Research behind the design

Measurements that shaped llav, made in the SemIf repository before llav existed. The probe script is
`benchmarks/llama_server_probe.py` in SemIf; its outputs were kept outside any repository, so the numbers
below are the record. Hardware for all timings: a laptop with an Intel Arc B390 iGPU, llama.cpp build 10809,
Qwen3.5-4B Q8_0 GGUF (bartowski, the revision pinned in `scripts/fetch-model.sh`).

## Prompt fidelity and agreement

Workload: SemIf's owned `shape777` fixture, 37 states of about 1,800 tokens, 21 binary questions each, 777
decisions. Reference: SemIf's published BF16 PyTorch predictions from an RTX 3090.

- Rendering through llama-server's `/apply-template` and `/tokenize` reproduced all 777 prompt hashes,
  token counts and answer-token ids of SemIf's torch scorer.
- Serial-restored readout agreed on the argmax for 768/777 decisions against fresh reference scoring, 771
  against reference serial reuse, 772 against reference parallel reuse. Median absolute probability
  difference 0.005, 99th percentile 0.065, maximum 0.149.
- All 9 disagreements with fresh scoring were near-ties (0.47 to 0.53 in both runs), and 5 were exact
  0.5/0.5 ties in the reference. The reference's own reuse modes differ from its fresh mode on 5 to 6
  decisions, so this is within the reference's own noise.
- The model put at least 99.6% of its probability on the answer letters.

These results used SemIf's prompt wording. llav's choice-key folding and `Yes`/`No` noul options were
checked only for internal consistency: one 21-question request versus 21 single-question requests agreed on
21/21 choices, with probabilities within 0.008.

## Reusing a shared state

Per 21-question state:

| Approach                                              | Decisions/s | Notes                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fresh scoring, no cache                               | 0.27        | Full prompt every time                           |
| Serial with prompt cache                              | 0.69        | Partial reuse through checkpoints                |
| Serial, primed with the state prefix                  | 1.1 to 1.25 | Full reuse, but two checkpoint saves per request |
| Parallel slots (21 at once), primed or not            | 0.24        | Every slot recomputes the whole state            |
| Primed, copied to 21 slots via save/restore, parallel | 1.05 to 1.57| Reuse works; parallel suffixes do not batch      |
| **Serial-restored, `--ctx-checkpoints 0`** (llav)     | 2.3 to 2.8  | About 20 ms per restore, about 0.2 s per question |
| SemIf torch XPU shared mode, same GPU (reference)     | 5.6 to 6.7  | One batched pass for all 21 questions            |

The full 777-decision serial-restored run averaged 2.28 decisions/s; a 3-state run reached 2.75. The slower
full run had longer state reads, possibly GPU throttling (not confirmed).

## Backend and runtime comparisons

`llama-bench`, prompt processing, tokens per second:

| Test                                  | Vulkan | SYCL  |
|---------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| 77 tokens                             | 506    | 405   |
| 512 tokens                            | 872    | 1,306 |
| 1,891 tokens                          | 721    | 804   |
| 77 tokens after 1,812 in context      | 305    | 335   |

SYCL gained about 3% end to end on serial-restored, but needs the oneAPI toolkit and
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/oneapi/<version>/lib`. Vulkan is the default.

## Other models

`scripts/fetch-model.sh` also pins IBM Granite 4.0 Micro and SmolLM3-3B (Q8_0). Checked on 2026-09-22 with
the four-question support-ticket request from the README plus one yes/no question ("Is the customer
praising the product?"), nothing more:

- Both pass `Engine`'s startup checks: `A`–`Z` are single tokens and the template tail does not merge
  with a label.
- Both put at least 99.9% of the next-token probability on the declared letters for every question.
- SmolLM3 renders `Reasoning Mode: /no_think` and an empty `<think>` block with `enable_thinking: false`.
- Answers compared with Qwen3.5-4B on the same request:

| Question                    | Qwen3.5-4B        | Granite 4.0 Micro  | SmolLM3-3B          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Urgent (noul)               | 1.00              | 1.00               | 0.99                |
| Praising the product (noul) | 0.00              | 0.00               | 0.11                |
| Department (choice)         | billing 0.85      | technical 1.00     | technical 0.77      |
| Frustration (score, 0 to 2) | 0.94              | 1.00               | 1.01                |

Granite is near-certain on every question, including the department question, where billing is the
better answer for failing payouts. That points to worse calibration than Qwen's, from one example only.
Neither model's accuracy against labelled data has been measured, and neither has been timed on a long
state.

## Rejected approaches

- **Context checkpoints for prefix reuse.** Debug logs showed llama-server saving two 50 MB checkpoints per
  request (one duplicate of the checkpoint it had just restored, one at the end of the prompt), each a copy
  off the GPU of about 170 ms. `--ctx-checkpoints 2` and `--cache-ram 0` changed little. Replaced by
  save/restore through files, since copying onto the GPU is fast.
- **Parallel slots for one state.** llama.cpp does not batch several sequences of this hybrid model
  efficiently; 21 concurrent questions took as long as or longer than serial.
- **Forking llama.cpp.** Rejected while the system package works; a fix belongs upstream.
- **PyTorch runtime.** Faster for shared states (batched suffixes), but needs per-hardware torch builds,
  Triton toolchains and a workaround for a CPU fallback in Qwen3.5's attention on Intel XPU.

## Open questions

- Accuracy of llav's own wording (choice keys folded, `Yes`/`No` nouls) against labelled data: unmeasured.
- Whether a BF16 GGUF closes the remaining probability differences, which would attribute them to Q8_0
  quantization: untested.
- A native program on libllama (`llama_memory_seq_cp` or `llama_state_seq_*` plus batched `llama_decode`)
  might match torch's batched shared mode. Untested; the Arch `llama-cpp` package ships `llama.h`.
- Accuracy and throughput of Granite 4.0 Micro and SmolLM3-3B on the `shape777` workload: unmeasured.
- Throughput on other GPUs (CUDA, Metal): unmeasured. The README's scaling table is an extrapolation from the
  laptop figures; replace it with measurements when available.
